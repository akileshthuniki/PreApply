# AWS Resource Patterns for Infrastructure Layer Categorization
# Used by human formatter to categorize resources into logical layers

# Foundational layer: Core networking infrastructure
# Resources that form the base of the infrastructure
foundational:
  - vpc
  - subnet
  - network
  - virtual_network  # Azure
  - compute_network  # GCP

# Networking layer: Connectivity and routing
# Resources that handle network connectivity and routing
networking:
  - nat
  - gateway
  - route
  - peering
  - vpn
  - eip
  - elastic_ip
  - transit_gateway
  - vpc_endpoint
  - vpc_peering
  - route_table
  - internet_gateway
  - nat_gateway
  - vpn_gateway
  - direct_connect

# Security layer: Security and access control
# Resources that enforce security policies
security:
  - security_group
  - firewall
  - acl
  - waf
  - network_acl
  - network_security_group  # Azure
  - compute_firewall  # GCP

# Application layer: Application-facing resources
# Resources that directly serve applications
application:
  - lb
  - alb
  - nlb
  - elb
  - target_group
  - listener
  - service
  - function
  - lambda
  - ecs
  - ec2
  - instance
  - container
  - kubernetes
  - eks
  - fargate
