# PreApply Configuration
# Transparent, adjustable, explainable risk scoring weights and thresholds

blast_radius:
  # Weight for shared resources (resources used by multiple services/modules)
  shared_resource_weight: 30
  
  # Weight for each downstream service affected
  downstream_service_weight: 10
  
  # Multiplier for critical infrastructure (applied to shared_resource_weight)
  # Critical types get: shared_resource_weight × critical_infrastructure_multiplier
  critical_infrastructure_multiplier: 1.3
  
  # Multiplier for delete actions (higher risk)
  delete_action_multiplier: 2.0
  
  # Multiplier for update actions
  update_action_multiplier: 1.5
  
  # Multiplier for create actions
  create_action_multiplier: 1.0

risk_levels:
  # Risk level thresholds (0-100 scale)
  low: 30
  medium: 60
  high: 100

shared_resources:
  # Resource types that are considered "shared infrastructure"
  # These are typically single points of failure
